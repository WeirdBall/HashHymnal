Tune: When Johnny Comes Marching Home 
AKA: I Put My Hand upon Her Toe

I met a whore in the park one day,
Yo ho, yo ho.
I met a whore in the park one day,
Yo ho, yo ho.
I met a whore in the park one day,
She said "Hey hasher, you want a lay?"
Get in, get out quit fucking about,
Ya ho, Yo ho, yo ho.

I put my hand upon [her toe],
Yo ho, yo ho.
I put my hand upon [her toe],
Yo ho, yo ho.
I put my hand upon [her toe],
She said "Hey hasher, [you're way too low.]"
"Get in, get out quit fucking about."
Ya ho, Yo ho, yo ho.

_(Following the same format, but replacing part or all of a line as appropriate.)_
* …her knee / …quit teasing me.
* …her thigh / …you're way too shy.
* …her twat / …you've hit the spot.
* …her tit / …you're getting it.
* …her eye / …you're way too high.
* …my cock right in her mouth / …_choking noises, or spit beer across the circle_.
* And now she's in a wooden box,
She died from sucking hasher's cocks.
* We dig her up every now and again,
We fucked her once; we'll fuck her again.
* And now she'd dead but not forgotten,
We fucked her once; we'll fuck her rotten.
* The worms have eaten her through and through,
That just means there's more holes to screw.

_(If you want a shorter song, just skip some bodyparts and some of the post-death verses.)_
