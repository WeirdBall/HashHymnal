Tune: She’ll be Comin’ Round the Mountain

Oh, the eagles they fly high in Mobile. _(In Mobile!)_
Oh, the eagles they fly high in Mobile. _(In Mobile!)_
Oh, the eagles they fly high,
And they'll shit right in your eye;
You thank God that cows don't fly,
In Mobile!

In Mobile, in Mobile, _(Fuck, shit, piss)_
In Mo-, in Mo-, in Mo-, in Mobile.
Oh, the eagles they fly high,
And they'll shit right in your eye;
You thank God that cows don't fly,
In Mobile!

*Verses*

* The Sherif is a bugger,
And his deputy's another,
And they bugger one another…
* There's a lack of clean glasses,
'Cause those mother-fucking hashers
Stick the glasses in their asses…
* The women wear tin undies,
But they takes 'em off on Sundays;
You should see the boys on Mondays…
* There's a lack of good whores,
But there's keyholes in the doors,
And there's knotholes in the floors…
* They built a brand new lighthouse,
But birds used it as a shite-house,
Now the lighthouse is a white house…
* There's a lack of shit-paper,
So they hold it till it's vapor,
And they light it with a taper…
* If you ever are in jail,
And you are in need of tail,
Well, the Sherif's wife's for sale…
* Oh the cows are all dead,
But the children must be fed,
So they milk the bulls instead…
