Tags: sex, young
Tune: YMCA

Young girl, I like it when you go down,
I said: young girl, with your knees on the ground,
I said: young girl, with your lips full and round,
You make me so happy.
(Spit, spit, spit, spit, spit.)

I want to spray you with My D-N-A!
I want to spray you with My D-N-A!
It's a present from me, for all the young girls,
I hope you like to wear pearls.
